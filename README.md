# Nodejs Expressjs MongoDB Ready-to-use API Project Structure

A ready-to-use boilerplate for REST API Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

## Getting started

This is a basic API skeleton written in JavaScript ES2015. Very useful to building a RESTful web APIs for your front-end platforms like Android, iOS or JavaScript frameworks (Angular, Reactjs, etc).

This project will run on **NodeJs** using **MongoDB** as database. I had tried to maintain the code structure easy as any beginner can also adopt the flow and start building an API. Project is open for suggestions, Bug reports and pull requests.

## Features

- Basic Authentication (Register/Login with hashed password)
- JWT Tokens, make requests with a token after login with `Authorization` header with value `Bearer yourToken` where `yourToken` will be returned in Login response.
- Pre-defined response structures with proper status codes.
- Included CORS.
- **Book** example with **CRUD** operations.
- Validations added.
- Included API collection for Postman.
- Light-weight project.
- Test cases with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).
- Code coverage with [Istanbuljs (nyc)](https://istanbul.js.org/).
- Linting with [Eslint](https://eslint.org/).

## Software Requirements

- Node.js **20+**
- MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)

## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd eminence_machine_test/api
npm install
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Change the values of the file to your environment. Helpful comments added to `.env.example` file to understand the constants.

### Running API server locally

```bash
npm start
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm start`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```
Open http://localhost:3001 to view it in your browser/postman.

**Note:** `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/routes/` and add it in `/routes/api.js` it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers

If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file in `/controllers/` and use them in the routes.

## Tests

### Running Test Cases

```bash
npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.

### Creating new tests

If you need to add more test cases to the project just create a new file in `/test/` and run the command.

## ESLint

### Running Eslint

```bash
npm run lint
```

You can set custom rules for eslint in `.eslintrc.json` file, Added at project root.
